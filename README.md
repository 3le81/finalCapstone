## Task Manager Application

## Description

The Task Manager Application is a program developed as the final project for the HyperionDev bootcamp in Software Engineering. It serves as a practical demonstration of proficiency in working with lists, functions, and strings handling in Python programming. This project showcases essential software development principles learned throughout the bootcamp, providing hands-on experience in building a functional application from scratch. It allows users to register accounts, add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as complete, edit tasks, and generate reports.
